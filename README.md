# busbuddy
Displays departure time and bus number for a given bus route via GCP Directions API on a raspberry pi

The raspberry pi will be connected to a display, then mounted to a wall. The display will show different bus routes from a given location
(likely a home address) to a certain destination, as well as what time to leave the origin in order to arrive to the bus top on time.

The program will be updated once a minute in order to provide accurate data (based on delays and other traffic issues).
